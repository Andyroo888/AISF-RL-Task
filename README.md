# RL Assignment: BipedalWalker-v3
This repository contains the PPO implementation for solving the BipedalWalker-v3 environment (Normal and Hardcore modes) using Stable Baselines3.

#Files
AISF_ablation.ipynb contains the script with my simulations in normal mode, ASIF_ablation_hard for hard mode
oracle_run(1) is the video for normal mode- I could not upload the video for hard mode due to a runtime disconnection preventing me from accessing the video
